						First, you can choose what your character looks like, and
						enter your REAL name, a comma, and your team. Ex: Ananya, Team C8lin
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>One person will be given 3 words to choose from.</li>
						<li>They will pick one word to draw.</li>
						<li>Once they start drawing the word, everyone else can try to guess what that picture is in the chat section.</li>
						<li>It will automatically say that you guessed the word correctly after you do.</li>
						<li>Based on how fast you guess what the picture is, you get a certain amount of points.</li>
						<li>On the top right corner of the screen, it will show how many letters the word is.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						When you guess the word, it will automatically show that you guessed the word.
						(See that it says “Madi guessed the word!” on the right).
						On the left, where you can see all the others playing,
						it will also show the number of points you and others have.
						You can see that the person that has the pencil next to their profile is the person drawing.

						If you are drawing, when you scroll down to the bottom of the page,

			<h2>How the Event Works</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<ul>
					<li>We will be splitting each team into different breakout rooms on Zoom,
						which are separate rooms where you and your team can work together to guess the word. 
					<li>One person from each team will be participating in a round, so make sure only 1
						person actually joins the game. (rest of team can help)
					<li style="list-style-type:none">
						<ul>
							<li>Ex: 6 teams - 6 people in one round - 1 from each team</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>We will play 2 games today and next Friday. You should rotate the person
						who actually participates in the game, but each member will be able to help another either way
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<h2>The Raffle</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The 3rd place team will get 1 raffle, the 2nd place team will get 2 raffles,
							and the 1st place team will get 3 raffles.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:none">
							<ul>
								<li>However, each team will get an additional raffle for participating because
									we want everyone to have a fair chance in getting the prize.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>At the end of the game, we will draw out one raffle and that team will get the prize.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
